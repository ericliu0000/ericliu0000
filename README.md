## Hello! 

I'm Eric (he/him), a:
- first-year college student interested in computer programming
- graduate of a *FIRST*® Robotics Competition and a *FIRST* Tech Challenge team
   - I'm returning this year to volunteer in these programs, as well as *FIRST* LEGO® League!

### Projects
There are a few repos I have listed on my profile. Some of them are for school, some of them are for robotics, and one of them is for a research internship.
Thank you for visiting!
