## Hello! 

I'm Eric (he/him), a:
- first-year college student interested in computer programming
- former member of a *FIRST*Â® Robotics Competition and *FIRST* Tech Challenge team
   - I'm returning this year to volunteer in these programs!

### Projects
There are a few repos I have listed on my profile. Some of them are for school, some of them are for robotics, and one of them is for a research internship.
Thank you for visiting!
